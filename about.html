	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>My interest in weightlifting began when I was only 16 years old. Even though I had tried playing basketball, football, and even baseball none of those were found to be in my interest. I found a true sweet escape from reality everytime I stepped into the gym. I love to cook my own meals because it is important that I am feeding my body with the right nutrition. For cardio, I like to go swimming because it is a full body exercise and it's fun. Music is something I also really enjoy and look forward to.</p>
